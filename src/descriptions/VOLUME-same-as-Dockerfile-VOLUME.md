## VOLUME (same as Dockerfile VOLUME)

#### Synopsis

* `VOLUME <path-to-target-mount> <path-to-target-mount> ...`
* `VOLUME ["<path-to-target-mount>", <path-to-target-mount> ...]`

#### Description

The `VOLUME` command creates a mount point at the specified path and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes. It works the same way as the [Dockerfile `VOLUME` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume).
