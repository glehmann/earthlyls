## CMD (same as Dockerfile CMD)

#### Synopsis

* `CMD ["executable", "arg1", "arg2"]` (exec form)
* `CMD ["arg1, "arg2"]` (as default arguments to the entrypoint)
* `CMD command arg1 arg2` (shell form)

#### Description

The command `CMD` sets default arguments for an image, when executing as a container. It works the same way as the [Dockerfile `CMD` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd).
