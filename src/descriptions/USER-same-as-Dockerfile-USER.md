## USER (same as Dockerfile USER)

#### Synopsis

* `USER <user>[:<group>]`
* `USER <UID>[:<GID>]`

#### Description

The `USER` command sets the user name (or UID) and optionally the user group (or GID) to use when running the image and also for any subsequent instructions in the build recipe. It works the same way as the [Dockerfile `USER` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user).
